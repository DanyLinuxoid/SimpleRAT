# SimpleRAT

Small RAT/Backdoor written fully in C#.
After installation and launch, listens on port specified in JSON configuration. After successfull connection gives remote shell.
Developed for Windows.

Currently is FUD as it is small and simple, without any specific features.

TODO/Plans: 
1. File upload/download;
2. Merge JSON configuration into exe file;
3. Register in registry for startup;
